# Small-Projects-I-Made
A collection of smaller projects that were tasked to me mainly by others. Further detail to each project/challenge in each folder


## Volume Counter
In this rather small challange I was tasked to take an array of random length, made of positive numbers, and look at them like building blocks. I then needed to write a program that automatically decides how much empty spaces there are, that could be filled with water.  
*A.e.:  
[5, 0, 3] could fit 3 water in entry 1 - [0, 4, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1] is an a bit tougher example, which could hold 6 spaces of water*

## Staircase WIP
I'm tasked to count how many possible ways there are to walk up a random amount of steps of a staircase. Sounds easier than done, as I need to take into account that a person going up the stairs can also take 2 steps at once.
